# 3D Stratigraphic Modelling of the Dutch Sector  

## Introduction  
This project, undertaken as part of the **Data Visualization with Python (22CSA471)** course at Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology (NMIT), focuses on developing a 3D stratigraphic model of the Dutch offshore sector in the North Sea Basin. By leveraging seismic data, well logs, and advanced modeling techniques, the study investigates the geological complexities and hydrocarbon potential of the region. The research enhances geological understanding, facilitates reservoir characterization, and optimizes resource extraction strategies.

## Dataset  
The seismic data used in this study is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gustavoscholze/f3-dataset).  

## Methodology  
The methodology involves:  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Integration of seismic data in SEG-Y format with well log data.  
2. **Seismic Interpretation:**  
   - Interpretation of stratigraphic surfaces using seismic attributes and Wheeler transformations.  
3. **3D Modeling:**  
   - Construction of stratigraphic and structural models for analyzing subsurface features.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The initial analysis focused on examining the seismic data to identify key attributes, such as amplitude and coherence, that aid in interpreting geological features. The well log data was analyzed for properties like porosity and permeability, contributing to reservoir characterization.  

## Approach  
1. **Seismic Data Processing:**  
   - Preprocessed 3D seismic survey data to enhance signal quality and resolution.  
2. **Seismic Attribute Analysis:**  
   - Extracted attributes for detailed stratigraphic and structural interpretation.  
3. **Wheeler Transformation:**  
   - Applied to visualize the depositional history and stratigraphic relationships.  
4. **Well Log Integration:**  
   - Integrated lithological and petrophysical data from well logs for reservoir modeling.  
5. **Model Construction:**  
   - Built a 3D grid representing subsurface structures and property distributions.  
6. **Validation:**  
   - Calibrated models using independent data sources to improve accuracy.  

## Results  
- **3D Model Output:**  
  The final stratigraphic model provided a detailed visualization of the Dutch Sector's geological structures, including stratigraphic layers, fault systems, and potential hydrocarbon reservoirs.  
- **Reservoir Insights:**  
  Enhanced understanding of reservoir compartments and their connectivity.  

## Error Evaluation Metrics
